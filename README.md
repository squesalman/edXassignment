This branch serves for working copies of Project 0

Details of Project 0 as below :
Design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

Requirements :
- Must have at least 3 pages
- user should be able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that page
- user should be able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page
- Google Advanced Search page, the user should be able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options)
    - Find pages with… “all these words:”
    - Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
    - Find pages with… “any of these words:”
    - Find pages with… “none of these words:”
- Google’s own Advanced Search page, the four options should be stacked vertically, and all of the text fields should be left aligned
    - Consistent with Google’s own CSS, the “Advanced Search” button should be blue with white text. When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked, the user should be taken to search results page for their given query
- Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link should take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page
- Aesthetics. CSS written should match Google's Page own aesthetics as possible
